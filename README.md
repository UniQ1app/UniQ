# UNIQ: Universal Intelligent Qubic
**White Paper — Educational & Governance Ecosystem**

---

## 1. Vision and Objectives

UniQ is a **Learn-to-Earn** mobile platform designed to transform community engagement within the Qubic ecosystem.

- **Expertise:** Turning passive users into *Power-Users* and qualified ambassadors.
- **Circular Economy:** Creating intrinsic value through the UNIQ token, supported by real deflationary mechanisms.
- **Network Simulator:** Reproducing Qubic's hierarchy (Quorum 676, Computors, Arbitrators, Miners) to educate through practice.

---

## 2. User Journey and Grades

Ascension within UniQ is strictly meritocratic, based on knowledge acquisition.

- **Training Hierarchy:** Novice → Pathfinder → Expert → Legend → Master
- **Educational Tools:** Interactive quizzes, flashcards, and practical simulations.
- **Examination System:** Accessing higher grades requires a payment in UNIQ. Any failure results in the burning of the committed tokens.
- **Anti-Cheat:** Qubic ID integration, dynamic question banks, and strict timers.

---

## 3. Tokenomics

The UNIQ token is the heart of a closed-loop system designed for scarcity.

- **Total Supply:** 20,000,000 UNIQ
- **The "Golden Split" (Flow Distribution):**
  - **50% BURN:** Immediate destruction to ensure constant deflation.
  - **30% REWARDS:** Direct compensation for active network participants (Miners & Computors).
  - **20% TREASURY:** Technical maintenance and AI evolution.

## 4. Roles and Governance (Phase 2)

The project shifts to full autonomy once the critical mass of experts is reached.

**Selection and Responsibilities:**

- **Computors (676 members):** Elected from the top-performing "Masters." Stake UNIQ collateral. Vote on governance and validate content.
- **Miners (uPoW - User Proof-of-Work):** Creators of educational content. Earn UNIQ if their work is validated by Computors.
- **Arbitrators (50 members):** Randomly selected weekly from active Computors to ensure impartial justice and resolve disputes.
- **AIGARTH (AI Tutor):** Acts as a personal tutor and system guardian during the growth phase.

---

## 5. Roadmap and Smart Transition

### Phase 1: The Forge (Launch)
- Open learning modules and exams.
- Assisted Governance: AIGARTH AI fulfills Quorum functions while first human Masters are trained.

### Phase 2: Critical Competence Threshold (CCT)
- **Target:** 6,760 active users
- **Transition:** At this threshold, the system possesses enough experts (10%) to fill the 676 Computor seats.
- **Handover:** Human Quorum takes full control; AI reverts to a support role.

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Expansion
- Integration of third-party Qubic projects (QMine, QCap, QBay)
- Launch global ambassador program and access to IPOs via UNIQ token

## 6. Risk & Attack Model

This section outlines potential risks to the UniQ ecosystem and the mitigation mechanisms in place.

### 6.1 Governance Risks
- **Centralization Risk:** During Phase 1, a small number of users may dominate decision-making.  
  *Mitigation:* AIGARTH AI supervises critical operations; all decisions logged on-chain.
- **Collusion among Computors:** Top performers could bias content validation.  
  *Mitigation:* 50 Arbitrators randomly selected weekly.
- **Quorum Shortfall:** Fewer than 10% of active users reach Master status before CCT.  
  *Mitigation:* Partial AI governance persists until quorum seats are fully filled.

### 6.2 Economic Risks
- **Token Hoarding:** Users accumulating UNIQ without contributing.  
  *Mitigation:* Exam fees burned on failure; rewards mainly to active participants.
- **Market Volatility:** Deflationary mechanics may create temporary spikes.  
  *Mitigation:* Treasury allocation stabilizes operations and incentives.

### 6.3 Technical Risks
- **Smart Contract Bugs:** Errors in payments, staking, or rewards logic.  
  *Mitigation:* Modular, upgradable contracts with continuous AI/human audits.
- **Sybil Attacks:** Fake accounts manipulating progression.  
  *Mitigation:* Qubic ID, dynamic question banks, and strict timers.

### 6.4 Security Recommendations
1. Conduct third-party smart contract audits before Phase 2 activation.
2. Maintain real-time analytics for token flows and user activity.
3. Allow temporary AI-assisted governance in case of quorum disruption.
4. Enable community reporting for early detection of fraud or collusion.

> **Note:** This Risk & Attack Model evolves continuously as the UniQ network grows. Updates will be published on GitHub to maintain transparency and trust.

## 7. Final Note

UniQ is **the essential training and command center** for the Qubic network.  
It ensures:

- Long-term stability
- Organic creation of Computors
- Sustainable token economy
- Education-driven meritocracy

The UniQ model is fully designed to **scale with Qubic**, preparing the ecosystem for a future of autonomous governance and secure decentralized growth.
