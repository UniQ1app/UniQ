# UNIQ: Universal Intelligent Qubic
**White Paper + SWOT + Risk & FAQ**  
Educational & Governance Ecosystem

---

## 1️⃣ Vision and Objectives

UniQ is a **Learn-to-Earn** mobile platform transforming community engagement in the Qubic ecosystem.

- **Expertise:** Turn passive users into *Power-Users* and qualified ambassadors.
- **Circular Economy:** Create intrinsic value via UNIQ token with deflationary mechanisms.
- **Network Simulator:** Reproduce Qubic's hierarchy (Quorum 676, Computors, Arbitrators, Miners) for practical learning.

---

## 2️⃣ User Journey and Grades

- **Training Hierarchy:** Novice → Pathfinder → Expert → Legend → Master
- **Educational Tools:** Interactive quizzes, flashcards, practical simulations
- **Examination System:** Access higher grades via UNIQ payment; failed exams burn tokens
- **Anti-Cheat:** Qubic ID, dynamic question banks, strict timers

---

## 3️⃣ Tokenomics

| Allocation | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| 50% Burn | Scarcity and deflation |
| 30% Rewards | Active participants (Miners & Computors) |
| 20% Treasury | Technical maintenance & AI evolution |

**Total Supply:** 20,000,000 UNIQ

---

## 4️⃣ Governance & Roles (Phase 2)

- **Computors (676):** Top Masters, stake UNIQ, validate content, vote
- **Miners (uPoW):** Create content, earn UNIQ when validated
- **Arbitrators (50 weekly):** Randomly selected to ensure impartiality
- **AIGARTH (AI Tutor):** Supervises Phase 1, guides users, supports system

---

## 5️⃣ Roadmap & Smart Transition

**Phase 1: The Forge** – Learning & AI supervision  
**Phase 2: Critical Competence Threshold (CCT)** – 6,760 users → 676 Computors  
**Phase 3: Ecosystem Expansion** – Integrate QMine, QCap, QBay; launch global ambassadors & IPO access

## 6️⃣ SWOT Analysis

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Strengths** | - Perfect Qubic alignment (training Computors)<br>- Deflationary tokenomics<br>- Meritocratic system<br>- Intelligent governance (Arbitrators + AI)<br>- Clear, scalable roadmap |
| **Weaknesses** | - Dependence on AI Phase 1<br>- High complexity for beginners<br>- Requires sufficient active users to reach CCT<br>- Needs strong engagement to avoid stagnation |
| **Opportunities** | - First official Computor laboratory<br>- Replicable for other chains/projects<br>- Standard for community training & activation<br>- Partnerships for IPO and third-party integration |
| **Threats** | - Low adoption or user drop-off<br>- Token volatility if usage limited<br>- Smart contract bugs<br>- Perception issues with pay-to-learn or AI governance |

## 7️⃣ Risk & Attack Model

**Governance Risks**
- Centralization early Phase 1 → Mitigation: AI audit logs
- Collusion → 50 random Arbitrators weekly
- Quorum Shortfall → Partial AI supervision until quorum reached

**Economic Risks**
- Token hoarding → Exam burn + reward distribution
- Market volatility → Treasury allocation stabilizes ecosystem

**Technical Risks**
- Smart contract bugs → Modular contracts, AI & human audits
- Sybil attacks → Qubic ID, dynamic questions, timers

**Security Recommendations**
1. Third-party audits before Phase 2
2. Real-time monitoring
3. Temporary AI governance fallback
4. Community reporting system
