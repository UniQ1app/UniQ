# UniQ — The Educational Hub of the Qubic Ecosystem

> **Learn. Practice. Earn.**

UniQ is a **Learn-to-Earn educational and practice platform** designed to onboard, train, and retain highly educated users within the **Qubic ecosystem**.

UniQ is built in **two complementary phases**:
- **Phase 1**: Education & Certification  
- **Phase 2**: Live Practice of the Qubic System  

Together, they create a living, evolving application that mirrors how Qubic actually works.

---

## 🎯 Vision

UniQ transforms passive users into **active, competent participants**.

The goal is not only to learn Qubic —  
but to **live it, practice it, and understand its incentives from the inside**.

UniQ builds:
- Strong hands instead of emotional holders
- Merit instead of speculation
- Long-term conviction instead of hype cycles

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

> *“People don’t truly understand a system until they live inside it.”*

UniQ reproduces Qubic’s logic:
- Roles
- Competition
- Rotation
- Responsibility
- Incentives

Education alone is not enough.  
**Practice is what keeps the system alive.**

---

# 🧩 PHASE 1 — Education & Certification (Foundation)

**Phase 1 is fully managed by the UniQ team.**

This phase focuses on structured learning, validation of knowledge, and economic discipline.

# ⚙️ PHASE 2 — Live Practice & Qubic Simulation (CRITICAL)

**Phase 2 is the heart that keeps UniQ alive.**  
This phase **requires collaboration with a Qubic developer**, as it mirrors real Qubic mechanics.

While Phase 1 teaches,
👉 **Phase 2 makes users live the system.**

---

## 🧬 Why Phase 2 Is Crucial

Without Phase 2:
- Phase 1 can feel “finished”
- Users may lose interest after certifications
- The app risks becoming static

With Phase 2:
- There is **always something to do**
- Competition never stops
- Users stay active, engaged, and progressing
- The app becomes a living ecosystem

---

## 🔄 What Happens in Phase 2

Users actively participate in **simulated Qubic roles**:

### 👤 Roles Practiced

- **Computors (Simulated)**  
  - Elected based on performance
  - Responsible for validation tasks
  - Subject to rotation and evaluation

- **Arbitrators**  
  - Monitor fairness
  - Resolve disputes
  - Enforce rules

- **Miners / Contributors**
  - Support the system
  - Earn through consistency and accuracy

---

## ⏱ Epoch-Based Evaluation

- Performance is evaluated every **epoch (7 days)**  
- Users can:
  - Rise in rank
  - Lose privileges
  - Be rotated out

This mirrors real Qubic dynamics:
- No permanent power
- No stagnation
- Meritocracy only

---

## 🔐 Collateral & Responsibility

To access high-responsibility roles:
- Users must **stake (lock) $UNIQ**
- Misbehavior or inactivity results in:
  - Partial burn of the collateral

This guarantees:
- Honest behavior
- No sabotage
- Accountability

---

## 🧠 Learning by Doing

Phase 2 transforms theory into practice:
- Users apply what they learned in Phase 1
- They experience competition, pressure, rotation
- They understand Qubic not intellectually — but **experientially**

This creates:
- Deep understanding
- Respect for the protocol
- Long-term commitment

---

The UniQ team manages:
- News modules
- Network updates
- Educational content
- Interface & UX

Even non-competitive users benefit:
- Daily insights
