# 2. Philosophy & Core Dynamics

UNIQ channels human behaviors—curiosity, frustration, desire for recognition—into productive flows.

## Core Principles
1. **Merit over Money:** Capital unlocks responsibility, not influence.
2. **Contribution over Status:** Titles are earned dynamically.
3. **Validation over Visibility:** Information becomes truth via consensus.
4. **Long-Term Alignment:** Holding and verifying are rewarded; speculation reduces influence.

## Behavioral Mechanics
- Curiosity → engagement in Academy
- Frustration → motivates improvement
- Recognition → Merit Score stimulates further contribution
